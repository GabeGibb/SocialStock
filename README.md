This is the backend repo (hosted on replit) for an AI stock prediction mobile app. The backend is a Flask app that serves data from the Yahoo finance API, Twitter count API, and provides its own stock prediction endpoint that combines past tweets and stock info with a sci-kit learn machine learning model. The app works with many popular stocks.
